### Hey, Iâ€™m Jon Douglas ðŸ‘‹

By daylight, Iâ€™m a Principal Product Manager at Microsoft, guiding technology toward usefulness. By moonlight (and sometimes in the blurry middle hours), I lend my time to NIH and related efforts chasing a cure for Long COVID, a cause both urgent and deeply human.

Iâ€™ve written three books, each a small attempt to capture and share what Iâ€™ve learned along the way. And though words are finite, my inbox is always open because connection matters more than polish.
