### Hi, I'm Jon Douglas 👋

I'm a Senior Program Manager at Microsoft working on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) by day & content creator by night.

I’ve made it my goal to demystify the path to building a sustainable, profitable, and passionate career in the software industry.

I even went as far as writing a 200+ page book on the topic that you can [download for free](https://jondouglas.dev/free-book).

Here you will learn how to hack your habits, learning, focus, leadership, and body.

Each week I share big ideas that will take you from good to great. It all starts with a mindset shift of knowing you are capable of greatness.

Code, Lift, Ball 👨‍💻🏋️‍♂️🏀
