### Hi, I'm Jon Douglas 👋

I'm a Senior Program Manager at Microsoft working on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) by day & content creator by night.

I’ve made it my goal to demystify the path to building a sustainable, profitable, and passionate career in the software industry.

Here you will learn how to hack your habits, learning, focus, leadership, and body.

Each week I share big ideas that will take you from good to great. It all starts with a mindset shift of knowing you are capable of greatness.

Tech’s Tom Cruise 😎
